Oracle SQL -- Analytic functions OVER a group?

My table:

ID   NUM   VAL
1    1     Hello
1    2     Goodbye
2    2     Hey
2    4     What's up?
3    5     See you
If I want to return the max number for each ID, it's really nice and clean:

SELECT MAX(NUM) FROM table GROUP BY (ID)
But what if I want to grab the value associated with the max of each number for each ID?

Why can't I do:

SELECT MAX(NUM) OVER (ORDER BY NUM) FROM table GROUP BY (ID) 
Why is that an error? I'd like to have this select grouped by ID, rather than partitioning separately for each window...

EDIT: The error is "not a GROUP BY expression".
