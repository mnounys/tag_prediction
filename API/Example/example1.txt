Question : Is it possible to use C# Object Initializers with Factories
Body
<p>I\'m looking at the new object initializers in C# 3.0 and would like to use them. However, 
I can\'t see how to use them with something like Microsoft Unity. I\'m probably missing something but 
if I want to keep strongly typed property names then I\'m not sure I can. e.g. I can do this (pseudo code)
</p>\n\n<pre><code>Dictionary&lt;string,object&gt; parms = new Dictionary&lt;string,object&gt;();\nparms.Add("Id", "100");\n\nIThing 
thing = Factory.Create&lt;IThing&gt;(parms)();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then do something in Create via reflection 
to initialise the parms... but if I want it strongly typed at the Create level, like the new object intitalisers 
then I don\'t see how I can.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a better way?\nThanks</p>\n
